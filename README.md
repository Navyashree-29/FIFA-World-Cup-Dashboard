# Completion of FIFA World Cup Dashboard â€“ Data Analyst Intern at Unified Mentors

During my internship at Unified Mentors, I successfully designed and completed an interactive dashboard focused on FIFA World Cup data. The project involved gathering, cleaning, and analyzing historical World Cup data to provide insightful visualizations. Key metrics such as match results, player statistics, team performance trends, and country comparisons were highlighted.

The dashboard was developed using tools like Excel, Power BI, and Python for data manipulation and visualization. I ensured that the dashboard was user-friendly and designed to allow stakeholders to explore data interactively, making it easy to filter by year, teams, and individual players. This project significantly enhanced my skills in data analysis, visualization, and storytelling, while also showcasing my ability to handle real-world data challenges.
